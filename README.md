Java Card Game Project (2019) â€“ Skills Demonstrated

- Solo full-stack logic design: Originally intended as a group project, this was developed independently, showcasing end-to-end architecture skills.
- Error handling through loop control: Instead of relying on try-catch blocks, the program handles invalid input and edge cases through rigorous conditional logic and while-loop error trapping.
- Structured OOP design: Classes are well-separated and logically grouped (e.g. Deck, Card, Player), showing an early understanding of object-oriented programming principles.
- Menu-based interaction flow: Includes user-driven game selection (e.g. Hi-Lo, PU Banco), demonstrating dynamic flow control and user input parsing.
- Input validation and state management: Careful management of game states and input ensures consistency, even without modern frameworks or a GUI.
- Testing awareness: Includes early implementations of unit testing, highlighting understanding of test-driven development even in a basic console project.
