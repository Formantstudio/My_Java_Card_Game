# My_Java_Casino

This was a project written for my BCIS Java 2 programming class.

It's a text based Casino app that has a couple card games the user can choose to play. 

The majority of the code was written by myself. 

It was supposed to be a group project but since I can never rely on anyone, I do them by myself.

Should be uploaded soon.
